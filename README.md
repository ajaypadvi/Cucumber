# Cucumber



Notes:
1.To generate step definitions files automatically>>
If you want to generate the step diminutions for the gherkin syntax written in feature file then do alt+enter and you will get a prompt to specify the java file in which
the step definitions would be created.
This is all done using Cucumber tool plugin in intellij
